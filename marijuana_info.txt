Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is a psychoactive drug that has been used for both medicinal and recreational purposes. Its main psychoactive component is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the "high" sensation.

Cannabis is derived from the Cannabis plant, which has several species including Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. In addition to THC, marijuana contains over a hundred other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), which has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits without the psychoactive effects.

In recent years, many countries and states have moved toward the legalization or decriminalization of marijuana, particularly for medicinal use. Studies suggest that cannabis may help alleviate symptoms associated with chronic pain, epilepsy, anxiety, and multiple sclerosis.

Despite its benefits, marijuana use also carries risks, especially when used heavily or at a young age. It may impair short-term memory, judgment, and motor coordination, and its use has been linked to mental health issues in some individuals.

Ongoing research continues to uncover more about marijuana's effects on the human body and its potential uses in healthcare.
